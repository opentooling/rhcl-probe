# rhcl-probe

Tests a **Red Hat Connectivity Link** API gateway and an **OpenShift Service Mesh 3** end to end,
and shows which features work.

It installs a small demo app (frontend → catalog v1/v2 → pricing) and a console. The console
sends real traffic through your gateway and between the services, and reports each feature as
passed, failed or skipped. You can run it from the browser or with `helm test`.

```
Gateway ──► frontend ──► catalog v1 (90%) ──► pricing
 TLS, auth,              catalog v2 (10%)     pricing (faulty, outlier pool only)
 rate limits     every hop is mutual TLS and reports its caller, version and attempt count
```

## What it checks

| Group | Checks |
|---|---|
| Platform | Kuadrant ready · Gateway programmed · probe routes accepted · AuthPolicies and RateLimitPolicies enforced · sidecars injected |
| API gateway | TLS certificate (issuer, expiry) · HTTP→HTTPS redirect · host and path routing · default deny · API keys (missing, wrong, valid) · OIDC token (valid, tampered) · claim-based authorization (only `admin` may POST) · gateway → app mTLS · header match · weighted split · URL rewrite and header filters · request mirroring · route timeout · route rate limit · per-caller limits by plan |
| Service mesh | SPIFFE identity on every hop · request ID propagation · STRICT mTLS rejects plaintext · AuthorizationPolicy · east-west weighted split and header routing · retries · fault injection (abort, delay) · per-hop timeout · outlier detection · egress `REGISTRY_ONLY` · NetworkPolicy blocks gateway bypass |

A feature you switch off in the values (OIDC, NetworkPolicies, the platform's default deny…) is
reported as **skipped**, not failed.

The console's **Experiments** panel runs the same scenarios hands-on: pick traffic split,
retries, fault injection, circuit breaker, authorization or rate limit, send up to 60 requests
and see each result.

## Requirements

- OpenShift Service Mesh 3 (Istio 1.22+), sidecar mode, with the gateway in the mesh
- Connectivity Link (Kuadrant v1 policies) and a Gateway API gateway (v1.1+)
- An HTTPS listener whose hostname covers the probe's hostname

[jugash/RHCL](https://github.com/jugash/RHCL) sets all of that up with GitOps. The defaults
below match it.

## Install

```bash
oc new-project rhcl-probe
```

The gateway accepts routes only from labelled namespaces:

```bash
oc label namespace rhcl-probe api-gateway-access=true
```

```bash
helm install probe oci://ghcr.io/opentooling/charts/rhcl-probe -n rhcl-probe \
  --set gateway.hostname=probe.api.example.internal
```

Run the suite. `helm test` fails if any check fails:

```bash
helm test probe -n rhcl-probe --logs
```

Or open the console:

```bash
oc port-forward -n rhcl-probe svc/probe-rhcl-probe-console 8080:8080
```

## Configuration

The values you are most likely to set:

| Value | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway.name`, `gateway.namespace` | `api-gateway` | The Gateway the routes attach to |
| `gateway.hostname` | `probe.api.example.internal` | Hostname of the probe's routes. No DNS record needed: the console dials the gateway directly |
| `gateway.tls.issuerContains` | `""` | Expected issuer of the gateway certificate, e.g. `internal-ca` |
| `expect.defaultDeny`, `expect.httpRedirect` | `true` | Whether the platform enforces these |
| `auth.apiKeys.namespace` | `kuadrant-system` | Where Authorino reads API-key Secrets |
| `auth.apiKeys.alice`, `.bob` | generated | Set them under Argo CD, which can't keep generated keys |
| `auth.oidc.*` | off | Issuer and client for the client-credentials check |
| `trustedCA` | OpenShift trust bundle | CA the console trusts for the gateway and the IdP |
| `mesh.strictMTLS`, `.authorizationPolicies`, `.trafficManagement` | `true` | Mesh features to set up and check |
| `mesh.egress.registryOnly` | `true` | Limit the console to the mesh registry |
| `networkPolicies.enabled` | `true` | Ingress NetworkPolicies for the demo app |
| `extraObjects` | `[]` | Extra manifests, see below |

See [values.yaml](charts/rhcl-probe/values.yaml) for all of them.

### Example: the RHCL platform with Keycloak and Vault

[examples/rhcl-platform-values.yaml](examples/rhcl-platform-values.yaml) installs the probe on the
platform from [jugash/RHCL](https://github.com/jugash/RHCL), with:

- **OIDC** tokens from Keycloak. The `KeycloakClient` (for keycloak-client-operator,
  `keycloak.jugash.com/v1alpha1`) is a confidential client with the client credentials grant only, so it has no `redirectUris`,
  `postLogoutRedirectUris` or `webOrigins`. A hardcoded `plan` claim sets its rate-limit plan.
- **API keys from Vault**, synced by External Secrets, with `auth.apiKeys.create: false`.
- **A Route for the console**, off by default: the console has no login.

Each part is a conditional `extraObjects` item, switched by `features.*`.

### extraObjects

Anything else to deploy with the release: ExternalSecrets for the API keys, an OpenShift Route
for the console, policies of your own. Each item is a YAML object or a string, rendered with
`tpl`, so it can use the chart's helpers. Wrap an item as `{when, object}` to render it only
when a condition holds:

```yaml
features:
  consoleRoute: true
extraObjects:
  - when: "{{ .Values.features.consoleRoute }}"
    object:
      apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
      kind: Route
      metadata:
        name: '{{ include "rhcl-probe.fullname" $ }}-console'
      spec:
        to: { kind: Service, name: '{{ include "rhcl-probe.fullname" $ }}-console' }
        port: { targetPort: http }
        tls: { termination: edge }
```

## How it works

One image runs every role, chosen by `$ROLE`. Each service answers with what it saw, plus
the answer of the next hop:

```json
{"service":"frontend","caller":"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/api-gateway/sa/api-gateway-istio",
 "requestId":"…","status":200,
 "next":{"service":"catalog","version":"v2", "next":{"service":"pricing","attempt":2}}}
```

Checks steer the services with request headers, which each hop passes on:

| Header | Effect |
|---|---|
| `x-probe-fail: pricing=0.3` | pricing answers 500 on 30% of requests |
| `x-probe-delay: frontend=3s` | frontend waits 3s |
| `x-probe-scenario: retry \| fault-abort \| fault-delay \| timeout \| outlier` | selects the mesh route for that scenario |
| `x-version: v2` | routes to catalog v2 |

A pod outside the mesh (`outsider`) calls the services on request, to show what STRICT mTLS
(connection reset) and NetworkPolicies (timeout) do to traffic that bypasses the gateway.

### Service accounts

**Kubernetes ServiceAccounts.** The chart creates one per role: frontend, catalog, pricing,
outsider and console. They are mainly identities in the mesh:

- **Mesh identity.** Istio names each pod's certificate after its ServiceAccount, e.g.
  `spiffe://cluster.local/ns/rhcl-probe/sa/probe-rhcl-probe-frontend`. The
  AuthorizationPolicies use these to allow only frontend to call catalog, and only catalog to
  call pricing. With one shared ServiceAccount, every pod would have the same identity, and
  neither the policies nor the SPIFFE ID checks could tell them apart.
- **API access for the console only.** The console reads the status of the Gateway, Kuadrant
  and the policies, with read-only RBAC. The other ServiceAccounts mount no token at all.

catalog v1 and v2 share one ServiceAccount, and so do both pricing pods: each pair is one
service, so it gets one identity.

**`serviceAccountsEnabled` on the Keycloak client.** It turns on the client credentials grant,
the only way an unattended pod can get a token. Login in a browser needs a person, and the
password grant would mean storing a user's password (OAuth 2.1 drops it). Keycloak creates a
user for the client, `service-account-rhcl-probe`, whose ID is the token's `sub`: the caller
the gateway's rate limits count. Without it, set `auth.oidc.enabled: false`, and the OIDC check
is skipped.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
```

```bash
helm lint charts/rhcl-probe -f charts/rhcl-probe/ci/full-values.yaml
```

Run a role locally:

```bash
ROLE=frontend PORT=9001 NEXT=http://localhost:9002 go run .
```

CI starts with a Trivy scan of the repository (Go dependencies, secrets, the Dockerfile) and of
the chart as rendered with each `ci/` values file. Every other job waits for it, and a fixable
HIGH or CRITICAL finding stops the pipeline. Findings that are accepted on purpose are listed,
with the reason, in [.trivyignore](.trivyignore).

Every push to `main` then builds, smoke-tests and scans the amd64 and arm64 images, and publishes
`ghcr.io/opentooling/rhcl-probe:sha-<commit>` with the chart at
`oci://ghcr.io/opentooling/charts/rhcl-probe` (version `0.1.<run>`, defaulting to that image).
